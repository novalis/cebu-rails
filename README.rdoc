Install RVM:
    $ curl -L get.rvm.io | bash -s stable

Install Jruby:
    $ rvm install jruby

Use Jruby:
    $ rvm use jruby

Install the bootstrapping gem:
    $ gem install bundler

Install the rest:
    $ bundle install

Install the Java libraries
    $ mvn package

Run:
    $ rails server

To use a development version of a library, you need to do the following
before running rails server:

    $ rm lib/name-of-library.jar

    $ export CLASSPATH='lib/*'

    $ ln -s /path/to/library/target/classes/* .

Yes, you really have to put the library into the root directory of
cebu-rails.  I'm not really sure why.

Remote debugging:

You'll need to have openplans-tracking-tools set up in Eclipse as a maven
project.

    $ jruby -J-Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=y,address=8000 -J-Xdebug script/rails server

The server will wait for a debugger to connect.

Then, in eclipse, Run > Debug Configurations > Remote Java Application
Click "new".  Select openplans-tracking-tools as the project.  Click
"Debug".  Now you can place breakpoints and do all the usual things.
